## 📖 About The Game

Dungeon Slayer is a 3D Action-RPG designed specifically for mobile devices. The goal was to bring the depth of PC role-playing games to the palm of your hand. 

In this project, I focused on creating a robust architecture that handles complex RPG systems like inventory management, stats, and real-time combat while maintaining high performance on mobile hardware.

### ✨ Key Features

* **🗡️ Dynamic Combat System:** Fluid attack animations, hit detection, and enemy AI behavior.
* **🎒 Advanced Inventory System:** * Grid-based inventory logic.
    * Item equipping, stacking, and consumption mechanics.
    * Dynamic UI that updates in real-time.
* **📱 Optimized Mobile Controls:** Touch-responsive joystick and action buttons designed for smooth navigation.
* **🌲 Immersive 3D World:** Optimized lighting and level design for mobile rendering pipelines.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

This project demonstrates advanced Unity development skills:

* **Scriptable Objects:** Used heavily for Item Data (Weapons, Potions, Quest Items) to make the game easily expandable.
* **Singleton Pattern:** Implemented for GameManager and UIManager to ensure efficient state management.
* **Event System:** Decoupled architecture using C# Actions/Delegates for interactions between the Player, Inventory, and UI.
* **Animation State Machine:** Complex blend trees for smooth transitions between Idle, Run, and Attack states.
